# GildedRoseTest
Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

## Description
This is my JS (Jest) resolution of the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata including Typescript with Ecma Script !
You can know more about it here : [Gilded Rose Repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

I have destructured the items by categories instead of 1 managers by item, it's more efficient for code reuse

I just had to find a trick to make Jest work with the Shop class
